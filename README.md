# OnTrack

This app was created for runners by a runner. It is meant to help runners keep themselves accountable and track their progress while training for a race.

## Getting Started

This is the frontend for the project, and it is built in Javascript/React. Fork and clone this repo to get started. It is paired with the backend repo (https://github.com/alexiscait142/capstone_backend).

### Prerequisites

In order to successfully run this app, you will need Javascript and React installed.

#### Required libraries
You will need to `npm install`
```
react-router-dom
```
if you do not have it globally installed.

### Installing

Once you have forked and cloned this repo and installed the proper packages, run `npm install` and it should automatically open in your browser. It will only work properly if you already have the backend running (see link above).
